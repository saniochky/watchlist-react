# [Watchlist React app](https://movie-watchlister.netlify.app/)

Watchlist React app is my Pet-project which demonstrates my FrontEnd(React) skills and knowledge.

This project is developed and hosted for demonstration purposes only. 

## Implemented technologies

### Hooks

Hooks that I've used in this project:

- useState
- useEffect
- useRef
- useReducer
- useCallback
- useContext
- useImperativeHandle

### Custom Hooks

I have also written custom hook useHttp, which helps loading data and transforming data via API.

## External libraries

### react-router-dom

Was used to implement routing in app.

### framer-motion

Was used to add animations to the main page.

### @fortawesome/react-fontawesome

Was used to add svgs across the app.

### react-card-flip

Was used to create flip effect on the Watchlist and Watched pages.

## Hosting

The app was hosted on [netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) under the domen https://movie-watchlister.netlify.app/.

## API

For movies recommendations and eventually across the application I use [TMDB API](https://www.themoviedb.org/).
